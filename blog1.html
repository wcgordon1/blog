        <p>You probably have two questions...</p>
        <h4>1. Why is the date format YYYY-MM-DD only?</h4>
        <h4>2. Why is the design so poor?</h4>
        <p>Funny you should ask. I just read a Tweet from Vitalik Buterin (Co-Founder of Etheruem) that the only correct
            date format is YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">YYYY-MM-DD is the only correct date format.<br><br>* It&#39;s an ISO standard: <a

        <p width="400px">When I was 21 I was attending UCLA and thought I was literally the smartest person in the
            world.
            I'm 35 now and
            realize I don't know anything. Now that I'm older I find it makes life simpler to copy successful people.
            Both
            frameworks have
            their flaws but seem to work just fine.</p>

        <p>Which leads me into why the design is so poor. Few reasons. Partly inspired by Jordan O'Connor (Read his blog
            <a href="https://jdnoc.com/blog/">here</a>). Originally, I was going to learn PHP tonight after listening to
            Courtland Allen and Peter Levels talk about coding everything in PHP. However, I think the point of that
            story
            is to stick with what you know. So, instead of spending hours on the CSS I'm just going to create html files
            and
            write this in VS Code.
