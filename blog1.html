        <p>You probably have two questions...</p>
        <h4>1. Why is the date format YYYY-MM-DD only?</h4>
        <h4>2. Why is the design so poor?</h4>
        <p>Funny you should ask. I just read a Tweet from Vitalik Buterin (Co-Founder of Etheruem) that the only correct
            date format is YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">YYYY-MM-DD is the only correct date format.<br><br>* It&#39;s an ISO standard: <a

            Now that I'm 35 I find it makes life simpler to copy successful people. So, date formatting has been solved
            moving forward.

        <p> This leads to why the design is so poor. Few reasons. Partly inspired by Jordan O'Connor (Read his blog
            <a href="https://jdnoc.com/blog/">here</a>). Originally, I was going to learn PHP tonight after listening to
            Courtland Allen and Peter Levels talk about coding everything in PHP over the past two years. However, I
            think the point of that
            story is to stick with what you know. If you're reading this I doubt you are here for design. My hope is the
            weird art I've created will be enough.
